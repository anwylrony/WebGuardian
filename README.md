## üöÄ Features

WebGuardian is not just another script; it's a modular framework built for professionals by professionals.

-   **Intelligent Crawling:** Discovers URLs, forms, and parameters while respecting `robots.txt` and implementing stealth techniques like delay and User-Agent rotation.
-   **Modular Scanning:** Easily run specific vulnerability checks (SQLi, XSS, etc.) or a full comprehensive scan.
-   **Data-Driven Approach:** Leverages extensive, external payload and signature files, making the tool's knowledge base easily updatable without touching the core code.
-   **High Performance:** Built on Python with a clean architecture, ready for C++ integration for performance-critical tasks.
-   **Structured Reporting:** Generates detailed, machine-readable JSON reports perfect for integration into other security tools or for generating professional client reports.
-   **Linux Native:** Designed from the ground up to run efficiently on Linux environments.
